## Technologies Used

Have a look at the technologies been used while developing [Uber-rebuilt](https://github.com/adarsh-sharma6218/Uber-rebuilt):

- [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) - Maps and location for developers. Provides custom online maps for websites and applications. It also contains different themes and styles to be used in a website.

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - The React Framework for Production.

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.



## Lessons Learned ðŸ”¥

- Learned a new JavaScript framework **Next.js**. Best thing about Next.js is that you don't have to write long code for **router** ðŸ˜… + **faster rendering** ðŸš€ (due to server side rendering). 
- **Styled components** in Tailwind CSS. This method is much cleaner than writing traditional Tailwind classes. 
- Implementing **Google Authorisation** through Firebase.
- React Hooks especially **useEffect** and **useState**.  
- Some important CSS properties like **position, flexbox, transform, transition, etc.**
